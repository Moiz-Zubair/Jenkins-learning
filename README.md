# 🚀 Jenkins Hands-On Playground

This repository is my personal learning space to explore **Jenkins** and related DevOps concepts through practical, hands-on experiments. The idea is to start small and keep building step by step — learning by doing.  

---

## 🛠️ Current Progress

- ✅ **Local Jenkins Setup**  
  - Deployed a simple Jenkins server using **Docker Compose**.  
  - Verified setup by running a sample **"Hello World" Jenkins Pipeline**.  

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- ⚡ Optimize the Docker image to **reduce build time**.  
- 🏗️ Experiment with **Jenkins Pipelines** for real-world tasks.  
- ☁️ Use Jenkins to **deploy infrastructure on AWS** via Terraform.  
- 🔄 Try out different CI/CD workflows and integrations.

## 📚 Learning Goal

The goal of this repo is not just to get Jenkins up and running but to **learn incrementally** by:  
1. Building small working setups.  
2. Expanding them into more complex scenarios.  
3. Documenting the journey for future reference.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo will evolve as I continue to learn. Expect frequent updates and experimental code/configurations.
